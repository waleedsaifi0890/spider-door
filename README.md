SpiderDoor enables tenants to rent a new unit, pay for the rent monthly, and get notified about the balance and charges applied. With SpiderDoor, the tenants could download the iOS or Android app and do everything themselves instead of calling location managers or visiting them personally.

## Features

- Text Collector
- Access control system
- The admin back-end (called SpiderAdmin) feature










## Text Collector

Text Collector automates delinquent payment reminders via text, allowing prompt payments through unique URLs, while warehouse managers efficiently track and manage payments on a dashboard for streamlined storage operations.

## Access Control System


SpiderDoor's success thrived through keypad integration, allowing access control and activity tracking while preventing delinquent entries via swift gate code changes synced with Text Collector reminders or app payments for instant access, facilitated by real-time balance updates via dedicated API calls.

## SpiderAdmin

was designed to support various admin roles. Admins can manage separate locations and groups of locations, change settings for mobile apps, send individual and group notifications to tenants, and view their Text Collector stats on a dashboard.
